Brief comments about the metamodel:

- The idea of using enum instead of an abstract class
is that it's easier to work with it as we have two attributes: price & type,
and with the type we can distinguish between both types and do not need
to model two rules for eating reds or eating blues and long as we keep being consistent with it.

- Numeric parameters used as counters are not needed except the one for the lap count, they're
for debugging purposes.
